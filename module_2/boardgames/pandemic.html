      <h2>Components</h2>
      <p>Pandemic comes with a variety of components that make the game engaging and immersive:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Game Board: </strong>The board represents a world map, divided into regions that are interconnected by lines of communication. These regions are susceptible to disease outbreaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Player Role Cards:</strong> Each player takes on a unique role with special abilities that can aid the team in different ways. Roles include the Scientist, Medic, Dispatcher, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>Disease Cubes:</strong> Colored cubes represent the spread of diseases on the board. These cubes can multiply and cause outbreaks if not controlled.</li>
        <li><strong>Infection Cards:</strong> These cards dictate which cities become infected with diseases during the game. Players must manage and contain these outbreaks to prevent global catastrophe.</li>
        <li><strong>Player Cards:</strong> These cards are used to travel between cities, discover cures, and strategize with team members. Finding sets of matching Player Cards is essential to curing diseases.</li>
        <li><strong>Research Stations:</strong> Players can establish research stations in cities to facilitate the sharing of information and the discovery of cures.</li>
